The project will focus on building a secure and scalable network using routing, switching, VLANs, WAN connectivity, and security measures. I will create the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, configure routers and switches, and implement features such as VLAN segmentation, subnetting, dynamic routing protocols, and access control lists.
